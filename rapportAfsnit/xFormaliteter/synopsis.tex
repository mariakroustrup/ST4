%Introduktion
The purpose of this project is to examine the possibility to control an exoskeleton during a squat exercise to support amyothrophic lateral sclerosis patients' muscles around the knee. This study consists of measurements from the muscle, rectus femoris, and two accelerometers. The inputs signals from the accelerometers calc
 A digital has system has been designed, implemented and tested to evaluate the system. The study is based on grey literature, articles, books and tests which has been analyzed and interpreted. It is not possible to use the system to help the patients currently since the prototype has not been developed due to lack of time. The test of the system shows that it possible to detect whether the user is moving upward og downward during a squat exercise by analysing the inputsignals from the rectus femoris and the accelerometres.
